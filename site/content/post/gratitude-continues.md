I am thankful for the folks over at Medium.com. They provided me with a free platform to share my appreciation with the world for 365 days in a row. I decided to design and develop my my own blog. Here it is, in all its gloryâ€“warts and all.

Why, you ask? I've moved away from Medium in an effort to take control of my own content. If you followed me there, now you can follow me here. 

I decided to go live before I have all the bells and whistles in place. I haven't setup RSS feeds, commenting capabilities, newsletter alerts, or anything _interactive_. For now, I'm kicking it old school. As time allows, I'll get those other things in place. Maybe.
