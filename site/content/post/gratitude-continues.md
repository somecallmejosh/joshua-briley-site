I am thankful for the folks over at Medium.com. They provided me with a free platform to share my appreciation with the world for 365 days in a row. Here's [the grand finale](https://medium.com/@joshuabriley/one-year-of-gratitude-day-365-a3cdd45e5491) of that 365-day gratitude challenge. It was a major accomplishment for me, and I'm proud of myself for doing it. 

After completion of that challenge, I decided to move away from Medium and design and develop my my own blog. Why, you ask? I've moved away in an effort to take control of my own content. The old challenge will remain over yonder, on Medium. The new stuff will be posted here.

This site is still a work in progress. I decided to go live before all the bells and whistles are in place. Consider this my MVP for now. I haven't setup RSS feeds, commenting capabilities, newsletter alerts, or anything _interactive_. I'm kicking it old school. As time allows, I'll get those other things in place. Maybe.

Here's to new beginnings. And if you're reading this, thank you.
