  Take a whiff. Go ahead... Can you smell that? I'm pretty sure it's mud. I
  don't normally enjoy that aroma. But, today I do. Today, it reminds me that
  something good is near. Spring!

I look around the yard and see little dirty snow banks holding on for dear life. The distance between them continues to grow, giving way to the ground below. As I witness this increasing divide, all I can think is, "fuck yes, it's about fucking time!" If you're going to stick around and read this blog, you should know that I say stuff like that to myself from time to time. 

The forecast for the rest of the week looks pretty fantastic. We're expecting temps in the forties and fifties for a few days in a row. Forty... isn't that a funny sounding word? Sorry. I digress. I guess I'm just excited to see sunshine and warmer temps in the forecast. 

I know we're not entirely free of the winter season. I expect another snowfall or two. But, I feel like we're on mile 990 of a 1000 mile trip. That last ten miles always feels pretty good. It's exciting. And the kids stop asking "how much longer till we get there" by this point. 

Right now, I'm not asking myself how much longer till spring. I can see it. I can smell it. I'm happy to be this close.

And that is my gratitude for today.
