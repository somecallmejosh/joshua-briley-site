  Gratitude isn't some magical force that changes my environment. It's a magical
  force that allows me to be feel good about it.

I spent an entire year looking for reasons to be grateful. It was an active process of searching for happiness or contentment or something other than my default state of ho-hum. And it worked. Not only did my general health and well-being improve, but things around me also started to shape up. My career took a big step forward, and our finances improved.  Lots of things began to "happen" for me. Or, did they?

I wondered if gratitude was responsible for these changes. Was I fooling myself? Had my situation actually improved, or was I merely more content with things as they were. Looking back on that year, I believe it was a little of both. Yes, I was tricking myself into thinking my situation was better than I thought it was. And it worked. Things were running the same course they had been for a while. But, I sure felt better about things. 

My career has seen considerable improvement over the last five to six years. But, I don't think I appreciated it. I have continually improved as a musician over the years. But, I haven't acknowledged my improvement. I have grown more patient as I have aged. But, I haven't given myself much credit. Instead, I have measured myself against what I think I should be. I have neglected what I am.

As I sit here and write this, I realize "what I am" is pretty damned good. "Who I am" hasn't really changed. "What I have" hasn't changed either. Gratitude isn't about making change. It's about acceptance. It's about taking a look at your life and realizing things are actually pretty great. It's about getting on with it and enjoying the life I have, and not longing for the one I don't. 

And that is my gratitude for today.
