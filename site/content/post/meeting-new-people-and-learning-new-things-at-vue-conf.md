  I'm writing bright and early from the hotel lobby in Tampa, FL. I'm here for a
  3-day tech conferenceâ€”Vue Conference, to be more specific. I'm here getting
  the skinny on my favorite Javascript framework and meeting interesting people.
  And I find myself laughing, a lot. That's a good thing.

Why all the laughter? No reason in particular. We're just a bunch of people from different places talking shop. We're sharing our stories from the trenches. We're also having conversations about our significant others, our kids, our hobbies, Russian collusion. You know, typical chit-chat stuff. 

Why am I writing about this? It feels good to connect with like-minded people. It's nice to create a bond with someone you've never met. It's also great to make a connection with someone who doesn't share your views. No need to let our personal, political, or other lifestyle views get in the way, right? MAGA's and anti-MAGA's are talking about apolitical stuff. LGTBQ'ers and non LGTBQ'ers... yep, they're talking, too. I can see nods of approval, smiles, and clinks of the glasses at the after-hours parties. All the makings of a strong, diverse, supportive community are here.

In a time where everything seems to be _A or B_, _in or out_, _black or white_, _1 or 0_, it's important to find common ground. Even if it's silly banter about nothing, we can find some way to connect. We can find laughter between our conflicting world views. We can find agreement somewhere between our opposing dogma.

Sure, I've learned some interesting tech stuff at this conference. I've got my notes and motivation ready to roll when I get back to work tomorrow. I can't wait to try some of these new strategies and techniques. But, the big takeaway for me at this conference is that people are better than the stories we see and hear in the news. 

It's a great feeling to meet people from different walks of life. It's easy to assume we don't share any common ground. That's the easy way out, in my opinion. Here, at this conference, I can see that we all want the same thing. Human connection. Laughter. Appreciation. Someone to listen to and understand our stories. Oh, and to [learn a little bit more about the coolest technology on the web](https://us.vuejs.org). #goVue

And that is my gratitude for today.
